        <b><u>Kori Rotti</u> is a traditional, iconic dish from the Tuluva community in the coastal Tulunadu region <mark>(Mangaluru/Udupi)</mark> of Karnataka, India.
        It consists of a thin, crispy, dried rice wafer (rotti) served with a spicy coconut-based chicken curry (kori gassi).
        Its origins are deeply rooted in coastal agricultural traditions, designed to maximize shelf life for stored food, often served during festivals and family celebrations.
